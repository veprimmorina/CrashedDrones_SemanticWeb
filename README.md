Title: Integrating UAV Crash Data into a Semantic Web Framework for Enhanced Operational Insights

Scope of the Domain: This project focuses on the domain of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), specifically 'killer drones,' within a Semantic Web context. The primary goal is to integrate and analyze crash data for these UAVs to gain insights that contribute to improved safety standards, operational efficiency, and strategic decision-making. This involves handling diverse datasets, including crash incidents, drone specifications, maintenance records, and potentially external data such as weather conditions.

Work Methodology:

CSV Data Analysis
A thorough examination of existing CSV datasets containing details of UAV crash events is conducted. This includes understanding the data structure and identifying key elements such as the date and time of the crash, drone models, crash locations, and reasons for the crash.

RDF Schema Design
A comprehensive RDF (Resource Description Framework) schema is designed to reflect the crash data. This schema defines classes such as Drone and CrashEvent, as well as properties like hasModel, crashLocation, and crashTime, laying the foundation for converting the CSV data into a Semantic Web-friendly format.

Data Conversion to RDF
Using Python and libraries like rdflib, scripts are developed to convert the CSV data into RDF format. Each row in the CSV is transformed into RDF triples that adhere to the predefined schema.

Data Integration and SPARQL Queries
SPARQL queries are utilized to extract and analyze data, looking for patterns and insights within the crash data.

Data Analysis and Visualization
The integrated data is analyzed to uncover patterns or commonalities in crash events. Data visualization tools are employed to represent these findings, aiding in the comprehension and presentation of the analysis.
